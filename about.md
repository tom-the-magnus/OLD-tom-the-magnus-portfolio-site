Hello there! I am **Tom Magnus**, the owner of this blog, a technical writer, and programmer living in New York City.

This blog was made to host my technical writings. I built this using GitHub pages, specifically with a Jekyll theme called Scriptor.

My most recent employment was at Teachable as Technical Support Agent, where I found my gift and passion for technical writing. I also enjoy the technical writing of Isaac Asimov and David Foster Wallace.

Additonally, I am currently earning my second bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Oregon State University's online program. 

As a hobbies, I like to read, write, watch movies, and work on this site. 

*Thanks for visiting and hope we can connect soon!*
